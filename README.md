<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
 
      To train for an upcoming marathon, Johnny goes on one long-distance run each Saturday. 
      He wants to track how often the number of miles he runs this Saturday exceeds the number of miles run the previous Saturday. 
      This is called a progress day.
      Create a function that takes in an array of miles run every Saturday and returns Johnny's total number of progress days.
      
      Examples:
      progressDays([3, 4, 1, 2]) ➞ 2
      // There are two progress days, (3->4) and (1->2)
      progressDays([10, 11, 12, 9, 10]) ➞ 3
      progressDays([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 9]) ➞ 1
      progressDays([9, 9])  ➞ 0
      
      Notes:
      Running the same number of miles as last week does not count as a progress day.
